Worksheet 2: Sample size for disease detection

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

A: 59 individuals

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

A: The sample size necessary to detect in condition a) for a population of 5000 frogs would require sampling of 290 individuals. For detection in the case of b) in a population of 5000 frogs, 224 individuals will have to be sampled. It requires less individuals to detect a disease with 2% prevalence at a higher confidence level than it does to detect a disease which is prevalent in 1% of a population, using a lower confidence.

Disease Ecology Midterm

**1**. True or False. If false, explain why the statement is incorrect                                     (**12 points**)

a\. Compared to macroparasites, microparasites have a shorter generation time and do not reproduce within the host.

**False, microparasites do reproduce within the host.**

b\. Using disease models, we can make accurate predictions of how a disease will spread in a real-world host population. 

**True**

c\. Chagas disease is a protozoal disease that is commonly transmitted by the triatomine bug (Kissing bug). It can also be transmitted by consumption of contaminated food or beverages (feces of infected triatomine bugs). Chagas disease is therefore a contagious disease.

**True**

d\. Epizootic Hemorrhagic disease always causes severe outbreaks in white-trailed deer populations across the US, resulting in high mortalities. 

**False, EHD outbreaks vary per region of the US. Outbreaks in northern latitudes are more likely to result in large mortality because infection is not enzootic and disease resistance is low.**

e\. White-tailed deer infected with brain worm (*Parelophostrongylus tenuis*) rarely exhibit any symptoms or clinical signs. But infected white-tailed deer pass infectious larvae through their feces. White-tailed deer with brain worms can therefore be described as infected, diseased and infectious. 

**False, while infected with the worm and shedding eggs the white tail deer are considered infected and infectious. However, unless there are symptoms of the disease such as the abnormal behavior observed in infected elk, then the deer cannot be referred to as diseased.**

f\. The deer mouse (*Peromyscus maniculatus*) infected with Sin Nombre Virus do not show any clinical signs, but excrete the virus in their urine, feces and saliva. Humans get infected via aerosolized droppings of an infected rodent. The illness caused by Sin Nombre virus in humans is called Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS). HPS is therefore a vector-transmitted disease.

**True**

2\. Compare and contrast the two measures of frequency of disease: Prevalence and incidence.                                                                                                                                                 (**5 points**) 

**Prevalence is the number of affected individuals as a proportion of the total number of individuals in the population. It can be expressed as infected / total number. Additionally, prevalence is only a measure of the disease load at the given time in which it is measured.**

**Incidence is a measure of risk. It is comprised of the number of new cases within a specified period of time divided by the number of susceptible individuals. Only a measure of risk, unlike prevalence which is a measure of currently infected hosts.**

3.  Match the following                                                                                                                         (**6 points**)

4\. Moose can get infected by consuming a gastropod infected with *Parelaphostrongylus tenuis* larvae. Infected moose exhibit clinical signs like weakness, incoordination, circling, paralysis, and eventual death. But moose are unable to propagate the parasite. Such hosts are called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.                                                          (**2 points**)

a\) Calculate the average recovery rate (γ) for Measles. Average infectious period for measles is 8 days.                                                                                                                               (**2 points**) 

**=1/8 days = 0.125 days**

b) Calculate the average recovery rate (γ) for Rotavirus. Average infectious period for Rotavirus is 1-3 weeks, average of 2 weeks.                                                                                (**2 points**) 

**=1/14 days = 0.071 days**

c\) The R~0~ for measles is estimated at 15 and 17 for rotavirus. Calculate β for both diseases.                                                                                                                                                (**2 points**) 

**measles: R~0~= 15 = β/0.125                   β = 1.875 days**

**rotavirus: R~0~= 17 = β/.071                    β= 1.207 days**

d\) Calculate R~eff~ for a measles outbreak in a population with 80% measles vaccination coverage.                                                                                                                                                (**3 points**)

6\. For any transmissible disease, which of the following host states are possible? (**6 points**)

1.  Infected but not diseased

2.  Infected and diseased

3.  Not infected but diseased

For each state, explain your reasoning and support your answer with at least one example from human or wildlife disease systems. If you believe a particular state is *not possible*, justify why with clear reasoning.

**Being infected but not diseased is possible because the pathogen could be present in a host without triggering a disease state. Such is the case with *Parelaphostrongylus tenuis* which when infecting a white-tailed deer host, does not cause any symptoms or diseased state. However, the deer is still infected and is being used for parasitic reproduction and subsequently sheds new pathogen through its feces.**

**An infected and diseased state is the typical assumption of any infection. An example would be any case of Covid 19, where the infected individual will show symptoms such as high fever, nasal and respiratory complications, and fatigue.**

**It is impossible for an individual to show symptoms of a disease that they are not infected with. Such an occurrence would likely be the result of a poor or inaccurate diagnosis or complex psychological complications such as hypochondria.**

7\. Estimate the incubation period for Campylobacteriosis and Norovirus gastroenteritis from the following Epidemic curves.                                                                                (**4 points**)

**For the campylobacteriosis outbreak, the incubation period is probably around 3 to 4 days. For the norovirus outbreak, the incubation period is probably around 48 hours.**

8\. In 2015, a mass die-off of Saiga antelope occurred in Kazakhstan, resulting in the deaths of over 200,000 animals within a short period. Briefly describe the proximate cause of this extraordinary mortality event and explain how it led to such large-scale deaths. What measures could be implemented to prevent similar mortality events in the future? Finally, discuss broader conservation strategies that could help safeguard Saiga antelopes from extinction due to disease outbreaks.                                                                                       (**20 points**)

**The proximate cause of the mass mortality event was the result of a hemorrhagic septicemia outbreak caused by commensal *Spirilla* after irregularly high temperature and humidity promoted bacterial proliferation. There are unfortunately not many feasible actions which can be taken to prevent mass mortality events such as these in the future. Instead, we proactively work to reduce anthropogenic stress on wild populations of saiga antelopes such as poaching or habitat loss.**

9\. In his 1933 book *Game Management*, Aldo Leopold dedicated a chapter to wildlife diseases, stating that wildlife disease is primarily an ecological issue driven largely by human actions. Do you agree with this perspective? Explain your reasoning, using at least two examples from wildlife disease systems to support your answer.                   (**6 points**)

**I believe that wildlife diseases occur regardless of human interactions, however the added stress of anthropogenic activity typically exacerbates the effects any one disease might otherwise have had. One example is of the saiga antelope, who experienced a mass mortality event as the result of abnormal environmental conditions. There are no feasible ways in which humans could have intervened to reduce the severity of the event, however anthropogenic disruptions to the wild populations, such as poaching or habitat loss have a negative effect on the population's ability to recover from severe mass mortality events. Another example of this is the bald eagle mass mortality caused by avian vacuolar myelopathy which was found to be a bioaccumulation of aetokthonotoxin (AETX) through the food chain. In this case the mode of infection was so complex that there would not have been a clear method by which to treat infected individuals. However, it is important to note that the mass mortality event was ultimately triggered by anthropogenic activity as the invasive plant species which produced the toxin was most likely introduced by maritime commerce vessels.**

10\. Define R~0~. Estimate R~0~ for the following scenario. Red flamingo represents an infectious case, and blue are susceptibles; an arrow indicates transmission. Explain your findings in the context of real-world utility of R~0~. (**10 points**)    

**R~0~ is the basic reproduction number, or average number of new infections caused by a single individual in a fully susceptible population. It is a metric of the potential transmissibility of an infectious agent andis defined as the effective contact rate divided by the recovery rate.**

**R~0~ for the flamingos is \~1.5**

11\. Steve studies a population of the Suwannee Alligator Snapping turtle (*Macrochelys suwanniensis*) in Florida. He has been conducting a mark-recapture study of this population since 2010.  Since 2015, he has documented cases of cutaneous fibroma in this population. The following data was collected by Steve:

Turtles without visible fibroma are considered susceptible to the disease. 

a) Which year has the highest incidence of turtle fibroma? Make sure you write appropriate unit for the incidence value.  Show your work.                                                                    (**5 points**) 

**2017 had the highest incidence of turtle fibroma (0.074 cases per turtle-year).**

**2015: 4/133= 0.030 cases per turtle-year**

**2016: 5/123= 0.065 cases per turtle-year**

**2017: 8/108= 0.074 cases per turtle-year**

**2018: 4/140= 0.028 cases per turtle-year**

**2019: 2/132= 0.015 cases per turtle-year**

b) When is the prevalence lowest? When is the prevalence highest? Write unit for prevalence if applicable.                                                                                                                   (**5 points**) 

**The prevalence of turtle fibroma was lowest in 2019 (1.8% prevalence of turtle fibroma).**

**The prevalence of turtle fibroma was highest in 2017 (7.1% prevalence of turtle fibroma).**

**2015: 4/133= 3% prevalence of turtle fibroma**

**2016: 5/125= 4% prevalence of turtle fibroma**

**2017: 8/112= 7.1% prevalence of turtle fibroma**

**2018: 4/125= 2.7% prevalence of turtle fibroma**

**2019: 2/136= 1.8% prevalence of turtle fibroma**

12\. The Dutch harbor seal population is estimated to be around 5400 with \~50% adults. Seals are susceptible to phocine distemper virus (PDV), but an estimated 40% of the adults in this population are immune to PDV by virtue of prior natural infection. How many seals in this population should be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity sufficient to prevent an outbreak of PDV in this population if the R0 is estimated to be \~3? Assume that all the adult seals that have survived prior PDV infection are tagged, and hence identifiable.                                                                                                                                              (**10 points**) 

**The necessary threshold for preventing an outbreak is 1/R~0~ or in this case 1/3. If PDV only causes disease in adult seals, the total number of susceptible individuals is 1,620 seals.  To prevent an outbreak, we need to vaccinate 2/3 of that population or 1,080 untagged seals.**

**Worksheet 4: Multihost pathogens, Spillover**

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations.

    False, camels are the primary reservoir species for the MERS-CoV virus.

2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV

    True

3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV

    True

4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%.

    False, the fatality rate for human cases is 35%

5.  The epidemic curve shows a point source outbreak.

    True

6.  Global MERS cases have declined sharply since 2019. Why do you think this decline occurred? Discuss possible ecological, epidemiological, and behavioral factors that may have contributed to the trend.

    The global decline in MERS cases may have declined significantly because of significant changes in international travel behavior due to restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic. Infected individuals are less likely to come in contact with others and therefore give the virus less opportunity to spread before the infection subsides.

**Worksheet 5**

**Marburg Virus Outbreak , Rwanda 2024**

The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.

1.  Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.

I would classify this outbreak as an emerging infectious disease (EID). As described by Fenton and Pedersen, an EID has a high within-H2 transmission rate but a low inter species transmission rate. MVD requires close contact with rousette or fruit bats for inter species transmission, but once infecting a human host, the transmission rate between infected individuals and uninfected individuals was very high. The intra species transmission rate was so hgih that the disease was initially labelled a 'caregivers disease' because those that were taking care of infected individuals frequently fell ill themselves. For this reason MVD is not a spillover event, because a spillover event require both low inter and intra specific transmission rates.

1.  What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?

According to the reading, Nutt 2025, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was highly effective in reducing transmission between infected individuals and caregivers in both a community and healthcare setting. Public education campaigns which promoted seeking out treatment early on when case symptoms emerged was also significantly beneficial in managing the outbreak. Enhancements to clinical care facilities, including the use of genomic analysis for contact tracing and mechanical ventilation, were advancements in clinical care that also played a large role.

**Worksheet 7**

Nipah Virus

Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventative measures recommended in each setting.

The mode of Nipah virus transmission in Malaysia is typically the result of infection by bridge hosts. The primary reservoir of Nipah virus are bats, such as the Indian flying fox, however human infection typically occurs after exposure to a bridge host, such as pigs or livestock, which were exposed to food that was half eaten by bats or bat feces. In Bangladesh, the typical mode of transmission is the consumption of contaminated food products, especially date palm sap, which is collected in baskets where the bats will feed and defecate into.

The difference in transmission modes directly impact the mitigation methods used to reduce the spread of the virus. In Malaysia, public education about the risk of interactions with pigs and livestock can encourage people to reduce interactions with pigs or livestock. In Bangladesh, food safety standards can be improved to require date palm sap farmers to protect their gear from bat intrusion.

Avian Reovirus

Avian Reovirus (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe its impact on the affect population.

ARV is mainly transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where the feces from an infected individual is ingested by a healthy host, which then results in the healthy individual falling sick. A secondary mode of transmission is via the respiratory tract, aerosilized virus can be inhaled and cause illness in healthy individuals. Outbreaks in high-intensity poultry production are usually the result of overcrowding, poor poultry house hygiene (not routinely cleaning out house and changing the litter or down), or contaminated feed or water. Outbreaks typically occur in colder months when birds are encouraged to aggregate together for warmth, the close proximity to one another increases the likelihood of viral transmission. ARVs are hardy and can survive outside of a host on feathers, litter, metal, and glass for up to 6 days, and even longer in water. They are resistant to high and low temperature stress, pH variability and to many conventional household cleaners. A winter mortality of crows was identified in 2001 over a broad range of North America and Europe and discovered to be caused by corvid orthoreovirus, which inflicts MME on crow colonies who aggregate together for warmth during winter months.

Langya henipavirus

Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potential EID?

The likely reservoirs are shrews and the transmission route is either through direct or indirect contact with shrews or domestic animals and livestock which have been exposed to half-eaten food or feces from infected shrews. LayV is classified as a spillover and not a potential EID because it is localized to the Shandong and Henan provinces in China.

**Worksheet 8**

61 raccoons were examined for roundworm (*Baylisascaris procyonis*) presence during autopsy. the following statistics are an analysis of the autopsy results.

**Summary-**

*B. procyonis* was present in 47.2% (37.7% - 56.8%; at 95% CI) of raccoons examined during the survey. Round worms were found in raccoons from every region (North, Central, and South) but infection was observed to be more prevalent in the Central (64.3%; 17.0% - 42.8% at 95% CI of raccoons infected) and South (62.8%; 37.1% - 84.7% at 95% CI of raccoons infected) regions than in the North (28.6%; 47.7% - 75.9% at 95% CI of raccoons infected) (p-value: 0.0016). Roundworm infection was observed to be more prevalent in females (65.1%; 55.2% - 73.7% at 95% CI) than males, however there was no significant difference in infections between the sexes across any of the regions (p-value: 0.2269). Of the raccoons that were infected with round worm, 65% (55.2% - 73.7%; at 95% CI) were young adults. There was a significant difference in the distribution of infections between ageclasses across regions, with 92.9% (68.3% - 99.6% at 95% CI) of infections in the Central region, 51.0% (36.6% - 65.2% at 95% CI) of infections in the North region, and 72.1% (57.0% - 84.1% at 95% CI) of infections in each regions being observed in young adults (p-value: 0.0067).

Overall, *B. procyonis* infection in raccoons during the 2013 and 2014 outbreaks in Missouri and Arkansas affected almost half of the overall population. Raccoons from the Central and South regions were more susceptible than those in the North regions, an there was a slightly increased risk of infection among females.
