Worksheet 2: Sample size for disease detection

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

A: 59 individuals

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

A: The sample size necessary to detect in condition a) for a population of 5000 frogs would require sampling of 290 individuals. For detection in the case of b) in a population of 5000 frogs, 224 individuals will have to be sampled. It requires less individuals to detect a disease with 2% prevalence at a higher confidence level than it does to detect a disease which is prevalent in 1% of a population, using a lower confidence.

Disease Ecology Midterm

**1**. True or False. If false, explain why the statement is incorrect                                     (**12 points**)

a\. Compared to macroparasites, microparasites have a shorter generation time and do not reproduce within the host.

**False, microparasites do reproduce within the host.**

b\. Using disease models, we can make accurate predictions of how a disease will spread in a real-world host population. 

**True**

c\. Chagas disease is a protozoal disease that is commonly transmitted by the triatomine bug (Kissing bug). It can also be transmitted by consumption of contaminated food or beverages (feces of infected triatomine bugs). Chagas disease is therefore a contagious disease.

**True**

d\. Epizootic Hemorrhagic disease always causes severe outbreaks in white-trailed deer populations across the US, resulting in high mortalities. 

**False, EHD outbreaks vary per region of the US. Outbreaks in northern latitudes are more likely to result in large mortality because infection is not enzootic and disease resistance is low.**

e\. White-tailed deer infected with brain worm (*Parelophostrongylus tenuis*) rarely exhibit any symptoms or clinical signs. But infected white-tailed deer pass infectious larvae through their feces. White-tailed deer with brain worms can therefore be described as infected, diseased and infectious. 

**False, while infected with the worm and shedding eggs the white tail deer are considered infected and infectious. However, unless there are symptoms of the disease such as the abnormal behavior observed in infected elk, then the deer cannot be referred to as diseased.**

f\. The deer mouse (*Peromyscus maniculatus*) infected with Sin Nombre Virus do not show any clinical signs, but excrete the virus in their urine, feces and saliva. Humans get infected via aerosolized droppings of an infected rodent. The illness caused by Sin Nombre virus in humans is called Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS). HPS is therefore a vector-transmitted disease.

**True**

2\. Compare and contrast the two measures of frequency of disease: Prevalence and incidence.                                                                                                                                                 (**5 points**) 

**Prevalence is the number of affected individuals as a proportion of the total number of individuals in the population. It can be expressed as infected / total number. Additionally, prevalence is only a measure of the disease load at the given time in which it is measured.**

**Incidence is a measure of risk. It is comprised of the number of new cases within a specified period of time divided by the number of susceptible individuals. Only a measure of risk, unlike prevalence which is a measure of currently infected hosts.**

3.  Match the following                                                                                                                         (**6 points**)

4\. Moose can get infected by consuming a gastropod infected with *Parelaphostrongylus tenuis* larvae. Infected moose exhibit clinical signs like weakness, incoordination, circling, paralysis, and eventual death. But moose are unable to propagate the parasite. Such hosts are called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.                                                          (**2 points**)

a\) Calculate the average recovery rate (γ) for Measles. Average infectious period for measles is 8 days.                                                                                                                               (**2 points**) 

**=1/8 days = 0.125 days**

b) Calculate the average recovery rate (γ) for Rotavirus. Average infectious period for Rotavirus is 1-3 weeks, average of 2 weeks.                                                                                (**2 points**) 

**=1/14 days = 0.071 days**

c\) The R~0~ for measles is estimated at 15 and 17 for rotavirus. Calculate β for both diseases.                                                                                                                                                (**2 points**) 

**measles: R~0~= 15 = β/0.125                   β = 1.875 days**

**rotavirus: R~0~= 17 = β/.071                    β= 1.207 days**

d\) Calculate R~eff~ for a measles outbreak in a population with 80% measles vaccination coverage.                                                                                                                                                (**3 points**) 

**=15\*.20 = 3**

6\. For any transmissible disease, which of the following host states are possible? (**6 points**)

1.  Infected but not diseased

2.  Infected and diseased

3.  Not infected but diseased

For each state, explain your reasoning and support your answer with at least one example from human or wildlife disease systems. If you believe a particular state is *not possible*, justify why with clear reasoning.

**Being infected but not diseased is possible because the pathogen could be present in a host without triggering a disease state. Such is the case with *Parelaphostrongylus tenuis* which when infecting a white-tailed deer host, does not cause any symptoms or diseased state. However, the deer is still infected and is being used for parasitic reproduction and subsequently sheds new pathogen through its feces.**

**An infected and diseased state is the typical assumption of any infection. An example would be any case of Covid 19, where the infected individual will show symptoms such as high fever, nasal and respiratory complications, and fatigue.**

**It is impossible for an individual to show symptoms of a disease that they are not infected with. Such an occurrence would likely be the result of a poor or inaccurate diagnosis or complex psychological complications such as hypochondria.**

7\. Estimate the incubation period for Campylobacteriosis and Norovirus gastroenteritis from the following Epidemic curves.                                                                                (**4 points**)

**For the campylobacteriosis outbreak, the incubation period is probably around 3 to 4 days. For the norovirus outbreak, the incubation period is probably around 48 hours.**

8\. In 2015, a mass die-off of Saiga antelope occurred in Kazakhstan, resulting in the deaths of over 200,000 animals within a short period. Briefly describe the proximate cause of this extraordinary mortality event and explain how it led to such large-scale deaths. What measures could be implemented to prevent similar mortality events in the future? Finally, discuss broader conservation strategies that could help safeguard Saiga antelopes from extinction due to disease outbreaks.                                                                                       (**20 points**)

**The proximate cause of the mass mortality event was the result of a hemorrhagic septicemia outbreak caused by commensal *Spirilla* after irregularly high temperature and humidity promoted bacterial proliferation. There are unfortunately not many feasible actions which can be taken to prevent mass mortality events such as these in the future. Instead, we proactively work to reduce anthropogenic stress on wild populations of saiga antelopes such as poaching or habitat loss.**

9\. In his 1933 book *Game Management*, Aldo Leopold dedicated a chapter to wildlife diseases, stating that wildlife disease is primarily an ecological issue driven largely by human actions. Do you agree with this perspective? Explain your reasoning, using at least two examples from wildlife disease systems to support your answer.                   (**6 points**)

**I believe that wildlife diseases occur regardless of human interactions, however the added stress of anthropogenic activity typically exacerbates the effects any one disease might otherwise have had. One example is of the saiga antelope, who experienced a mass mortality event as the result of abnormal environmental conditions. There are no feasible ways in which humans could have intervened to reduce the severity of the event, however anthropogenic disruptions to the wild populations, such as poaching or habitat loss have a negative effect on the population's ability to recover from severe mass mortality events. Another example of this is the bald eagle mass mortality caused by avian vacuolar myelopathy which was found to be a bioaccumulation of aetokthonotoxin (AETX) through the food chain. In this case the mode of infection was so complex that there would not have been a clear method by which to treat infected individuals. However, it is important to note that the mass mortality event was ultimately triggered by anthropogenic activity as the invasive plant species which produced the toxin was most likely introduced by maritime commerce vessels.**

10\. Define R~0~. Estimate R~0~ for the following scenario. Red flamingo represents an infectious case, and blue are susceptibles; an arrow indicates transmission. Explain your findings in the context of real-world utility of R~0~. (**10 points**)    

**R~0~ is the basic reproduction number, or average number of new infections caused by a single individual in a fully susceptible population. It is a metric of the potential transmissibility of an infectious agent andis defined as the effective contact rate divided by the recovery rate.**

**R~0~ for the flamingos is \~1.5**

11\. Steve studies a population of the Suwannee Alligator Snapping turtle (*Macrochelys suwanniensis*) in Florida. He has been conducting a mark-recapture study of this population since 2010.  Since 2015, he has documented cases of cutaneous fibroma in this population. The following data was collected by Steve:

Turtles without visible fibroma are considered susceptible to the disease. 

a) Which year has the highest incidence of turtle fibroma? Make sure you write appropriate unit for the incidence value.  Show your work.                                                                    (**5 points**) 

**2017 had the highest incidence of turtle fibroma (0.074 cases per turtle-year).**

**2015: 4/133= 0.030 cases per turtle-year**

**2016: 5/123= 0.065 cases per turtle-year**

**2017: 8/108= 0.074 cases per turtle-year**

**2018: 4/140= 0.028 cases per turtle-year**

**2019: 2/132= 0.015 cases per turtle-year**

b) When is the prevalence lowest? When is the prevalence highest? Write unit for prevalence if applicable.                                                                                                                   (**5 points**) 

**The prevalence of turtle fibroma was lowest in 2019 (1.8% prevalence of turtle fibroma).**

**The prevalence of turtle fibroma was highest in 2017 (7.1% prevalence of turtle fibroma).**

**2015: 4/133= 3% prevalence of turtle fibroma**

**2016: 5/125= 4% prevalence of turtle fibroma**

**2017: 8/112= 7.1% prevalence of turtle fibroma**

**2018: 4/125= 2.7% prevalence of turtle fibroma**

**2019: 2/136= 1.8% prevalence of turtle fibroma**

12\. The Dutch harbor seal population is estimated to be around 5400 with \~50% adults. Seals are susceptible to phocine distemper virus (PDV), but an estimated 40% of the adults in this population are immune to PDV by virtue of prior natural infection. How many seals in this population should be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity sufficient to prevent an outbreak of PDV in this population if the R0 is estimated to be \~3? Assume that all the adult seals that have survived prior PDV infection are tagged, and hence identifiable.                                                                                                                                              (**10 points**) 

**The necessary threshold for preventing an outbreak is 1/R~0~ or in this case 1/3. If PDV only causes disease in adult seals, the total number of susceptible individuals is 1,620 seals.  To prevent an outbreak, we need to vaccinate 2/3 of that population or 1,080 untagged seals.**

**Worksheet 4: Multihost pathogens, Spillover**

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations.

    False, camels are the primary reservoir species for the MERS-CoV virus.

2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV

    True

3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV

    True

4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%.

    False, the fatality rate for human cases is 35%

5.  The epidemic curve shows a point source outbreak.

    True

6.  Global MERS cases have declined sharply since 2019. Why do you think this decline occurred? Discuss possible ecological, epidemiological, and behavioral factors that may have contributed to the trend.

    The global decline in MERS cases may have declined significantly because of significant changes in international travel behavior due to restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic. Infected individuals are less likely to come in contact with others and therefore give the virus less opportunity to spread before the infection subsides.

**Worksheet 5**

**Marburg Virus Outbreak , Rwanda 2024**

The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.

1.  Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.

I would classify this outbreak as an emerging infectious disease (EID). As described by Fenton and Pedersen, an EID has a high within-H2 transmission rate but a low inter species transmission rate. MVD requires close contact with rousette or fruit bats for inter species transmission, but once infecting a human host, the transmission rate between infected individuals and uninfected individuals was very high. The intra species transmission rate was so hgih that the disease was initially labelled a 'caregivers disease' because those that were taking care of infected individuals frequently fell ill themselves. For this reason MVD is not a spillover event, because a spillover event require both low inter and intra specific transmission rates.

1.  What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?

According to the reading, Nutt 2025, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was highly effective in reducing transmission between infected individuals and caregivers in both a community and healthcare setting. Public education campaigns which promoted seeking out treatment early on when case symptoms emerged was also significantly beneficial in managing the outbreak. Enhancements to clinical care facilities, including the use of genomic analysis for contact tracing and mechanical ventilation, were advancements in clinical care that also played a large role.

**Worksheet 7**

Nipah Virus

Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventative measures recommended in each setting.

The mode of Nipah virus transmission in Malaysia is typically the result of infection by bridge hosts. The primary reservoir of Nipah virus are bats, such as the Indian flying fox, however human infection typically occurs after exposure to a bridge host, such as pigs or livestock, which were exposed to food that was half eaten by bats or bat feces. In Bangladesh, the typical mode of transmission is the consumption of contaminated food products, especially date palm sap, which is collected in baskets where the bats will feed and defecate into.

The difference in transmission modes directly impact the mitigation methods used to reduce the spread of the virus. In Malaysia, public education about the risk of interactions with pigs and livestock can encourage people to reduce interactions with pigs or livestock. In Bangladesh, food safety standards can be improved to require date palm sap farmers to protect their gear from bat intrusion.

Avian Reovirus

Avian Reovirus (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe its impact on the affect population.

ARV is mainly transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where the feces from an infected individual is ingested by a healthy host, which then results in the healthy individual falling sick. A secondary mode of transmission is via the respiratory tract, aerosilized virus can be inhaled and cause illness in healthy individuals. Outbreaks in high-intensity poultry production are usually the result of overcrowding, poor poultry house hygiene (not routinely cleaning out house and changing the litter or down), or contaminated feed or water. Outbreaks typically occur in colder months when birds are encouraged to aggregate together for warmth, the close proximity to one another increases the likelihood of viral transmission. ARVs are hardy and can survive outside of a host on feathers, litter, metal, and glass for up to 6 days, and even longer in water. They are resistant to high and low temperature stress, pH variability and to many conventional household cleaners. A winter mortality of crows was identified in 2001 over a broad range of North America and Europe and discovered to be caused by corvid orthoreovirus, which inflicts MME on crow colonies who aggregate together for warmth during winter months.

Langya henipavirus

Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potential EID?

The likely reservoirs are shrews and the transmission route is either through direct or indirect contact with shrews or domestic animals and livestock which have been exposed to half-eaten food or feces from infected shrews. LayV is classified as a spillover and not a potential EID because it is localized to the Shandong and Henan provinces in China.

**Worksheet 8**

61 raccoons were examined for roundworm (*Baylisascaris procyonis*) presence during autopsy. the following statistics are an analysis of the autopsy results.

**Summary-**

*B. procyonis* was present in 47.2% (37.7% - 56.8%; at 95% CI) of raccoons examined during the survey. Round worms were found in raccoons from every region (North, Central, and South) but infection was observed to be more prevalent in the Central (64.3%; 17.0% - 42.8% at 95% CI of raccoons infected) and South (62.8%; 37.1% - 84.7% at 95% CI of raccoons infected) regions than in the North (28.6%; 47.7% - 75.9% at 95% CI of raccoons infected) (p-value: 0.0016). Roundworm infection was observed to be more prevalent in females (65.1%; 55.2% - 73.7% at 95% CI) than males, however there was no significant difference in infections between the sexes across any of the regions (p-value: 0.2269). Of the raccoons that were infected with round worm, 65% (55.2% - 73.7%; at 95% CI) were young adults. There was a significant difference in the distribution of infections between ageclasses across regions, with 92.9% (68.3% - 99.6% at 95% CI) of infections in the Central region, 51.0% (36.6% - 65.2% at 95% CI) of infections in the North region, and 72.1% (57.0% - 84.1% at 95% CI) of infections in each regions being observed in young adults (p-value: 0.0067).

Overall, *B. procyonis* infection in raccoons during the 2013 and 2014 outbreaks in Missouri and Arkansas affected almost half of the overall population. Raccoons from the Central and South regions were more susceptible than those in the North regions, an there was a slightly increased risk of infection among females.

From: Luke Matvey

To: Alabama Department of Public Health-

I am writing to the Alabama Department of Public Health to reinforce the necessity of continuing countermeasures to prevent an mpox clade IIb resurgence outbreak. It is the state's responsibility to ensure the safety of its citizens by taking measures to reduce the risk of dangerous viral outbreaks such as clade IIb mpox. In my letter I will define key information about the virus and suggest outbreak prevention and response measures in the case of resurgence for consideration by the state authority.

Monkeypox virus (MPXV), causing Mpox, is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus from the Poxviridae family, which is subdivided into two different clades, clade I and clade II each with their own respective -a and -b subclades (World Health Organization, 2024). Mpox is a zoonotic virus endemic to the West African and Congo Basin. Its natural reservoir remains unknown, however the role of non-human primates, rodents, and domestic pigs have been highlighted as important vectors of infection at the animal-human interface (Doty et al., 2017). The virus spreads during close human-human contact and can also be contracted from contact with contaminated clothing or linens, or needles in shared spaces such as health care or tattoo parlors (World Health Organization, 2024). Infection causes rash, fever, sore throat, and headaches among other symptoms however the most predominant symptoms are skin lesions which may be difficult to distinguish between other lesion-presenting infections. Lesions manifest all over the body including the face, mouth, throat, palms of hands and feet, and groin/genital region (World Health Organization, 2024). The recommended diagnostic method includes swabbing lesions for identification using DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Treatment includes the management of symptoms to reduce pain and complications, specifically the rash. People who are identified to be at high-risk of infection are eligible for vaccination. High-risk individuals include health care workers, people in the same household as an infected individual, and people with multiple sexual partners especially gay men (World Health Organization, 2024). Mpox patients typically experience symptoms for 14-21 days, after which the virus subsides and the patient is no longer infectious or diseased.

In 2003 there was a prominent outbreak of clade II mpox in the U.S. associated with the importation of prairie dogs which results in 47 confirmed and probable cases of mpox across six states (CDC, 2024b). The virus was thought to be transmitted to the prairie dogs during cohousing with other African exotic pets while being transported to the U.S. for sale (Reynolds et al., 2006). During this outbreak there were no incidences of human-human transmission. Patients were cited to have contracted the virus through a variety of other means, including bites or scratches, handling animals without being bitten, and even simply being in the same room as infected animals (Reed et al., 2004). This was the first and only reported outbreak to begin outside of the African continent. The survival of mpox outside of Africa is solely reliant on the proliferation of the virus through infectious interactions between diseased and non-diseased individuals.

In 2022, an outbreak of clade IIb began in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and spread globally via travel by infected persons, resulting in more than 114,000 cases worldwide (CDC, 2025b). The exact source of the outbreak remains undetermined; however, the global spread is attributed to travel-related cases contracted while in the region and transmitted upon arrival outside of the African continent. High density points of interest during travel, such as airports or train stations, and confined spaces associated with travel, such as airplanes and train cars, can increase the risk of transmission.

In August of 2022, 19 cases of clade II mpox were reported in the state of Alabama but have been reduced to zero since then (Alabama Department of Public Health, 2022). The reduction in case numbers can be attributed to effective vaccination, infection-induced immunity, and public education regarding transmission routes, however the CDC warns that the risk of an mpox resurgence outbreak when reintroduced to the U.S. is greater than 35% (CDC, 2023). Resurgence risk may increase in the case that new infections are introduced from other countries, as new-unvaccinated people become sexually active, or if people who are highly sexually active do not receive the vaccine. Additional ways that resurgence may arise are as immunity wanes across the recovered and vaccinated population or if the virus mutates (CDC, 2024a). There are no known cases of clade 1 mpox in the U.S. as of May 10, 2024, and the risk an outbreak is classified as extremely by the CDC (CDC, 2023). Regardless, the state authority has the responsibility to continue campaigns which have proven successful in reducing the risk of an outbreak.

Effective measures to limit the transmission of mpox include the quarantine of infected individuals at home or in hospitals, a reduction or taking a break entirely from sexual activity with new partners, and strict adherence to infection prevention and control measures by health care workers (World Health Organization, 2024). Public education efforts have also proven to be effective in educating travelers about potential risks of infection when traveling to destinations of concern, the CDC yellow book is one such valuable resource (CDC, 2025a). It is important to inform demographics which are especially at risk and warn them against high-risk behavior, such as immunocompromised individuals, health care workers, and men who take part in sexual intercourse with other men.

I value and support the Departments continued dedication to protecting public health.

A concerned citizen,

Luke Matvey

**Worksheet 9**

1.  In 2024, a multistate *Salmonella* outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in the United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic spread of *Salmonella*? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard poultry owners that increased the risk of *Salmonella* transmission, and briefly explain why these behaviors facilitated human infection.

Specific human behaviors that contributed to the zoonotic spread of *Salmonella* from backyard poultry flocks include close handling and contact with animals. For example children are likely to try to cuddle or closely handle animals or their bedding/housing, and are likely to then touch their mouths, nose, or eyes. Civilians keeping backyard poultry flocks in the United States are often amateurs and are less likely to be able to catch and effectively treat disease outbreak in a timely fashion compared to industrial production efforts. Lastly, amateurs might overlook necessary sanitary maintenance, allowing for the proliferation of potential human pathogens. This can lead to direct infection during the handling of diseased animals or indirect infection by contamination of waterways via runoff with pathogen.

2.  Tall fescue grass in commonly infected with fungal endophyte (*Epichlooe coenophiala*) that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in grazing livestock.
    i.  What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal endophyte?

        1.  The tall fescue grass gains a 'healthier' appearance than non-infected grass. It increases in its durability by discouraging insects from feeding on it and increases reproductive success by increasing the tiller biomass produced by the host.

    ii. What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of fescue toxicosis in grazing systems?

        1.  Climate, soil nutrients, and grazing pressure

    iii. What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle?

         1.  Weight loss, rough and discolored coats, and decreased performance

**Worksheet 10**

1.  What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF?

    1.  Transmission occurs both by direct interaction between infected pigs, pork products, or swine production related material such as feed, equipment, trucks etc.. A second route is the vector-borne transmission by tick hosts, in which the virus can persist for months. Humans play a mechanical role in the transmission of the virus, meaning that while they themselves are not a host of the virus, the handling and transport of pigs and pork products facilitates the transport of the virus.

2.  Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity, progression, and management of Chlamydia in koalas?

    1.  KoRV co-infection suppresses the koala's immune system response to subsequent infections such as Chlamydia. Koalas with KoRV have a higher rate of Chlamydia infection and a higher bacterial load during infection because of the immune suppression by the Korv. Progression of the Chlamydia among the koala population has been exacerbated by the reduction of their habitat, greatly increasing the frequency of koala-koala interaction. The most effective management strategies so far have been antibiotic therapies, habitat restoration, and vaccine research.

3.  Snake Fungal Disease (SFD), caused by *Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola*, is an emerging threat to wild snake populations in North America.

    What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease (SFD)

    1.  Some of the surveillance and management challenges associate with SFD include the long incubation period and time until onset of symptoms. Snakes maybe infected with SFD for months before symptoms become apparent. Screening animals for infection is also highly intensive as it requires molecular analysis (qPCR) of multiple swab samples from a single individual to determine whether they are infected.

**Final Exam**

1\. True or False. If false, explain why the statement is incorrect (10 points)

\
a. Per the community--epidemiology continuum proposed by Fenton and Pedersen (2005), a disease caused by a pathogen with high between-species transmission and no within--target species transmission will be termed a spillover.

**False, a spillover requires the within-species transmission rate to be too low to sustain the pathogen while the between-species transmission rate is also low, but greater than zero. this this case infections do occur sporadically but they are not rampant. What is described in the question above better fits the definition of an apparent multihost pathogen, where within-species transmission rates are low but the between-species transmission is very high.**

\
b. A viral disease that is transmitted to susceptible hosts only by vectors is infectious as well as contagious.

**False, a contagious disease can be transferred between individuals directly, without the need for a vector of transport. An example of a infectoius disease that is not contagious is Tetanus, which requires the bacteria to enter through an open wound and cannot be transmitted between individuals.**

\
c. The eggs of *Baylisascaris procyonis* can be transmitted to humans by direct\
contact immediately after excretion by an infected raccoon.

**False, the eggs of *Baylisascaris procyonis* must be ingested by a host to cause infections however, the eggs are ready to infect a host as soon as they are excreted**

\
d. A fungus growing on tall fescue leaves is responsible for decreased feed intake in cattle grazing on this grass, resulting in reduced weight gain and lower milk production.

**True**

\
e. Northern cardinals are considered superspreaders species for West Nile virus.

**False, the American Robins are considered the superspreaders. Northern cardinals are actually considered the supersupressors because they are a less competent host of WNV.**

\
2. List the community-based interventions used for preventing *dracunculiasis*\
transmission in endemic regions. Explain how each intervention interrupts specific stages of the Guinea worm life cycle. How have these strategies evolved in recent years given the emergence of animal (particularly dog) infections? (10 points)

**Community-based interventions used to prevent *dracunculiasis* transmission include:**

-   **Public education: Through education, people can be warned not to interact with common water source when infected and reduce the total amount of *dracunculiasis* larvae present. People can also then take measures to clean their water and prevent themselves from getting infected. If people only drink clean water and do not recontaminate their water sources by trying to relieve burning sensations in water sources, then Guinea worm larvae will not make it into the human GI tract and the release off eggs from infected individuals will be interrupted.**

-   **Supplying water filters: Water filters can be used to remove harmful eggs, larvae, and copepods from the water and prevent infection from consuming tainted water. This can prevent initial infection of individuals with the worm through consumption of the copepod intermediate hosts.**

-   **Sourcing water from safe underground wells: water from underground wells is highly unlikely to be contaminated with *dracunculiasis* eggs because infected individuals are not going to be able to relieve their symptoms in the body of water, never giving the worm an opportunity to release eggs.**

-   **Applying safe chemical treatment to water sources: Chemical treatment can be used to kill copepods present in the drinking water source without tainting it or making it unfit for human consumption. This prevents initial infection from human consumption of contaminated water since there will be no pathogen present to ingest.**

**The discovery of dogs as an alternate definitive host made the erradication of Guinea worm much more difficult because dogs are free-roaming in this part of the world and they will eat the fish entrails during the fish harvest season, which were contaminated with Guinea worm larvae-containing copepods, causing disease. Since they are free-roaming, these dogs then travel around reinfecting water sources as they try to alleviate their symptoms. To tackle the issue of dog infections, they had to tie infected dogs up so that they do not have access to common water sources.**

\
3. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging prion disease of cervids and one of the most significant wildlife conservation challenges in North America. What are the main obstacles wildlife agencies face in managing and controlling CWD? (10 points)

**CWD is spread by direct and indirect contact with infection individuals and prions shed into the environment. Additionally, vectors of infection include plants and ticks, which can infect individuals when they are eaten or bitten. CWD infects cervid species, with most cases originating in facilities were cervids are kept captive. Species such as mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk, moose, and reindeer are all susceptible and may be kept in these facilities for game hunting purposes. Outbreaks occur when an infected individual escapes the enclosure and interacts with wild populations. The natural ranges of these cervid species often overlap, as is the case with mule deer and white-tailed deer, and can lead to mass outbreaks among wild populations. Other outbreaks occur when an infected individual is transported between facilities in captivity. In one case, an infected elk was transported form the US to South Korea and caused an outbreak.**

**Ways in which CWD is spread include the natural overlap between wild populations, the movement and distribution of infected individuals between captive facilities, infected individuals escaping said facilities, the transportation of carcasses after hunting, through contact with infected animal by-products (feces, saliva, urine, etc.), and common grounds where cervids might congregate, such as bait feeders or salt licks.**

**Management challenges include the fact that there is no vaccine or treatment to cure infection with, there are limited tools with which to manage it. Individuals who are in the infectious state are still pre- or early-symptomatic and are difficult to identify. Lastly, there is the potential for asymptomatic transmission fro direct interaction or from the environment, which gives the pathogen time to establish among the population before even being identified. There are also multiple stakeholders involved, meaning that there are regulations around how the cervids can be treated by state, private, and public stakeholders. Current strategies include restricting the movement of wild cervids, increasing hunting pressure to reduce population density and inhibit CWD transfer.**

**The most effective methods so far are phase-specific strategies which tailor management strategies to the prevalence phase at which CWD is currently established, either pre-introduction, pre-establishment, transition, and endemic phases. Different management strategies can be applied during different phases for better results. For example, sustainable surveillance focuses on predicting the amount of CWD present in the population during treatment by using analytic approaches to determine how the pathogen is establishing among a population. Preemptive strategies need to be managed regionally and include plans like stochastic fadeout, which manage things like harvest strategies to impede the spread of CWD.**

\
4. You are given data from a closed study population of 60 RFID-tagged armadillos monitored at sampling stations (no capture required). At the start of the study (December 2024) none were infected with *Mycobacterium leprae*. During the follow-up period, monthly assessments documented the following counts of infected animals in the population:\
• March 2025: 3 infected\
• April 2025: 5 infected\
• May 2025: 5 infected\
• June 2025: 8 infected\
• July 2025: 13 infected\
(No deaths, births, immigration, or recovery occurred during the study.)

\
a. Calculate the monthly incidence of *M. leprae* infection. Show your calculations\
and state the units.\
(5 points)

**Incidence in March 2025: 3/60 --\> 0.05 cases per armadillo-month**

**Incidence in April 2025: 2/57 --\> 0.035 cases per armadillo-month**

**Incidence in May 2025: 0/55 --\> 0.000 cases per armadillo-month**

**Incidence in June 2025: 3/52 --\> 0.057 cases per armadillo-month**

**Incidence in July 2025: 5/47 --\> 0.106 cases per armadillo-month**

\
b. Which month had the highest prevalence? Which month had the lowest\
prevalence? Show your calculations and state the units. (5 points)

**Prevalence in March 2025: 3/60 --\> 0.05 or 5%**

**Prevalence in April 2025: 5/60 --\> 0.083 or 8.3%**

**Prevalence in May 2025: 5/60 --\> 0.083 or 8.3%**

**Prevalence in June 2025: 8/60 --\> 0.133 or 13.3%**

**Prevalence in July 2025: 13/60 --\> 0.216 or 21.6%**

**The month of July had the highest prevalence of *M. leprae* infection among armadillo (21.6%), while the month of March had the lowest (5%).**

\
5. A beaver carcass was found at the Gunnison River Whitewater Park, Gunnison,\
Colorado in October 2025. Samples collected during the postmortem examination were submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. The lab reported that the animal was positive for Tularemia.

\
a. Name the etiological agent of this disease. What subspecies of this agent causes Tularemia in aquatic animals like beavers? (2 points)

**The etiological agent of this disease is the bacteria *Francisella tularensis*, and the subspecies which might cause infection in aquatic animals like beavers is *F. tularensis* subspecies *holartica*, referred to as the aquatic cycle or Type B.**

\
b. What are the different routes of transmission for this agent? (2 points)

**The routes of transmission of this agent differ between cycles. You can get Type A from direct contact with an infected animal, such as small mammals, or from infected tick and fly bites. Type B can be contracted through the ingestion of contaminated water, close contact with small aquatic mammals (such as beavers), through infected tick and fly bites, or through infected mosquito bites. Lastly, it can be inhaled and cause infection.**

\
c. Describe key features/characteristics of this pathogen in the context of human health/public health. (3 points)

**The extremely low infectious dose of *F. tularensis*, only requiring 10-50 organisms, is a major concern for public health because even the slightest exposure could lead to infection. As an intracellular pathogen, the bactiera can evade the immunesystem by hiding out inside of the host cells. There has not been any reports of human-human transmission of the pathogen. Signs and symptoms may vary depending on the mode of transmission. Ingesting the bacteria can lead to cervical lymphadenopathy while fly, tick, and mosquito bites may result in ulcer formation at the bite site. Feral and outside cats should be a concern as they have the habit of hunting rabbits. Also human activities like lawn mowing can aerosolize the pathogen and lead to pneumatic tularemia. The best advice is to avoid direct contact with dead small mammals like rabbits. Intesive treatment wtih doxycycline has proven successful in the past.**

\
6. Match the following (5 points)

\
a. Fungal pathogen of conservation concern **------** 2. *Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola*

b\. Avian Vacuolar Myelinopathy **---------------** 4. Aetokthonotoxin

c\. Tick-transmitted viral disease **---------------** 1. Powassan encephalitis

d\. Foreign Animal Disease **----------------------** 6. African Swine Fever

e\. Bell's palsy, Bulls-eye rash **-------------------** 3. *Borrelia burgdorferi*

\
7. Refer to the life cycle of blacklegged tick to answer 7a -- 7d. (8 points)

\
a. The two stages of blacklegged tick that can potentially transmit Lyme disease to humans are: \_\_\_**nymph**\_\_\_ and \_\_\_**adult**\_\_\_.

\
b. Preferred hosts of the larval stage of *Ixodes scapularis* are: \_\_**white-footed mice**\_ and\_\_**chipmunks**\_\_\_\_.

\

\
d. The natural reservoir and competent hosts of *Borrelia burgdorferi* in North America: \_\_\_**white-footed mice**\_\_\_. White-tailed deer are the \_\_\_**reproductive hosts, supporting the tick population**\_\_\_ in the Lyme disease system.

\
8. Georgia has a white-tailed deer population of \~ 1 million. A total of 1351 samples from hunter-harvested deer were tested for Chronic Wasting Disease in 2022. None of the samples tested positive for CWD. Using the hypergeometric distribution, Georgia DNR determines that CWD is not present above 0.2% prevalence in Georgia's white-tailed deer population. You are asked to comment on Georgia DNR's CWD surveillance approach. In your commentary, explain the downside of using hypergeometric distribution for making decisions about wildlife disease surveillance. (10 points)

**The GDNR estimated that the prevalence of CWD in its white-tailed deer population was not above 0.2% using a hypergeometric distribution after observing 0 infected individuals in a sample size of 1351. Since they were unable to find a single positive individual, they were correct in not assuming that the prevalence was simply 0%, instead it could be the case that they just happened to miss all of the infected individuals due to their sampling methods. Instead, they assumed that the prevalence was greater than zero but no more than 0.2%. After assuming this, they can use the hypergeometric table to determine hypothetically, the minimum number of deer necessary to sample in order to detect CWD. In this case, using the total population number (\~1 million), the prevalence of 0.02%, and a confidence of 95%, the GDNR should sample find at least one individual positive for CWD among 298 sampled deer. In this case, the GDNR sampled 1351 individuals and didnt find a single positive individual, this doesn't necessarily mean that the sample size given by the hypergeometric distribution is wrong, once again they could have just missed all the positive individuals by chance. In this case I would opt for using the rule of three since there was zero prevalence among the samples. The rule of three is 3/N, where n is the total number of sampled individuals, and in this case would be 3/1351= 0.002 or 0.2%.**

\
9.Place the following diseases in appropriate quadrants in the above figure. Explain your choice of quadrants. (10 points)\

**To answer this question I have named each quadrant using the labels designated in Figure 2 of the Fenton and Pendersen, 2005 publication provided in the files section on Canvas.**

**Quadrant 1:** **Case 1 - spillover**

**Quadrant 2: Case 2 - Apparent multihost pathogen**

**Quadrant 3: Case 3 - True multihost pathogen**

**Quadrant 4: Case 4 - Potential EID**

a\. SARS-CoV-2: **Quadrant 4 or a potential emerging infectious disease. SARS-CoV-2 is rarely transmitted between the reservoir species, bats, and the target host humans, however human-human transmission rate is very high. This is a textbook example of an potential EID, where H1 to H2 transmission rate is low but the within-H2 transmission rate is high, as defined by Fenton and Pederson.**

\
b. Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome: **Quadrant 1 or spillover. Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome is contracted through direct contact with contaminated rodent feces, but is not transmitted from human to human, humans are the dead end host. This is a textbook example of spillover, where transmission from H1 to H2 is rare and the within-H2 transmission does not exist.**

\
c. Langya Henipavirus: **Quadrant 1 or spillover. This pathogen is highly localized to the Henan and Shendong regions of China and is contracted through close contact with infected domestic animals and livestock. The reservoir of the pathogen are shrews, which livestock or domestic pets might then come in direct contact with their feces or other bodily fluids and become infected. human infection then occurs after close interaction with the infected lovestock or pets; there has yet to be any documentation of human-human infection. As defined by Fenton and Pederson, the H1 to H2 transmission rate here is low but still above the invasion threshold and the within-H2 transmission rate is very low or even zero.**

\
d. Brucellosis: **Quadrant 3 or a true multihost pathogen. In this case, both the within and between species transmission rates are high. An example would be the spread of brucellosis between elk and moose populations**

\
e. West Nile virus: **Quadrant 1 or spillover. There is transmission from birds to mosquitos to humans, however there is no human-human transmission so within-H2 transmission is low.**

\
10. Anisakiasis is the disease caused by infection with the stomach worm *Anisakis simplex*. It reaches sexual maturity and reproduces in marine mammals. In the following figure, identify the definitive host, a dead-end host, a paratenic host, and an intermediate host. Explain your answers. (8 points)

**Definitive host: Marine mammals, the definitive host is where the parasite reproduces. According to the diagram, the worm releases eggs into the mammal's feces, implying reproductive activity taking place in that host.**

**Dead-end host: Humans, the diagram does not have any arrows coming from the human host and moving onto any other steps. This leads me to infer that the cycle is broken, making the human host a dead-end host because the parasite is no longer able to continue reproducing. I'd assume this is because human feces is not a direct input to the marine environment and any eggs that may have been the result of worm reproduction within the human, mammal, host will not survive in a non-marine environment.**

**Paratenic host: Seafish and cephalopods, paratenic host are substitute hosts which are not he prefered intermediate host, but do not interrupt the live cycle of the worm pathogen. In this case the seafish and cephalopods might ingest the free living larvae or larvae-containing crustaceans, but then will be ingested by the marine mammal host, in this case a dolphin.**

**Intermediate host: Crustaceans, the crustacean ingests the free-living larvae and then becomes food for the larger mammal, which wouldn't otherwise filter feed for larvae.**

\
11. All infected hosts are diseased. Comment using appropriate examples. (3 points)

**Infection does not necessarily mean that the host is diseased. Infection is the presence of a pathogen which has the ability to produce disease in and or on an animal. The disease is that occurrence of a dysfunction as the result of the presence of that infection in the host. A pathogen can be present without causing a disease. An example of this might be West Nile Virus and its reservoir the American robin, who have the potential to be infected with WNV but often do not exhibit symptoms of an infection. Transmission of WNV typically occurs when a mosquito feeds on an infected individual and then goes on to bite other anmials. When infecting other species of birds, such as cormorants, bald eagles, flamingos, etc. the infection will cause disease, ultimately leading to death of the infected individual. Additionally, mosquitos may also bite humans, in which WNV infection causes flu-like symptoms of disease.**

\
12. Klepac et al. estimated an R0 of 2.5 for the 2002 Phocine Distemper virus epidemic in Dutch harbor seals. Assuming that an effective PDV vaccine is available, what proportion of the seal population should be vaccinated to prevent a future outbreak of PDV? (3 points)

**Percent vaccination necessary to prevent an outbreak is 1- (1/R0)**

13. What are some of the main challenges in managing wildlife diseases? Explain using relevant examples. (6 points)

**Some of the main challenges to managing wildlife disease include the impact of human action on wildlife habitat, the disease toll on conservation efforts, and that wildlife are the source of EID afflicting humans. Firstly, human development has had a significant impact on habitat reduction of wild animals. Deforestation and urban sprawl decrease the wild land coverage and force animals to converge in increasingly smaller areas, artificially increasing the frequency of interactions between individuals. A prime example of this is *Chlamydia* in koala populations, which is running rampant largely due to the reduction in natural koala habiat as the result of urban development. Secondly, the disease toll on wild populations has been so dramatic that the conservation effort spent to preserve species are more or less unable to keep up with the rate of extinction. An example of that is the Alleghany wood rat, who's population have been significantly reduced due to infection by round worm eggs deposited by raccoons outside wood rat dens. The large number of raccoons and the fact that they are wild and uncontrollable means that any efforts to conserve the Alleghany wood rat can easily be thwarted by random raccoon movement. Lastly, EIDs often crossover between wild animals and humans during close interaction. Transmission of EIDs between species usually occurs very rarely so keeping the public educated on the potential dangers of wildlife interactions is difficult because a majority of the population might never be exposed to the pathogen. One example is CWD in white-tailed deer. There is no vaccine treatment for CWD, instead complex manangement plans must be used to slow its spread. Even if there were such a therapy, the management of a wild deer population and treatment of infected individuals with a vaccine is an insurmountable task. There is just no feasible way such a treatment could work, the sheer scale and unpredictability of wild populations makes addressing infection on a individual level an impossible task. That is why when it comes to pathogens infecting large, wild populations complex management approaches like phase-specific strategies are the most effective measure in slowing down the spread.**
