**Worksheet 1**

Integrating code and text

Find the area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

The epidemiological triad is a simplification of a complex web of interactions occurring between host, environment, and pathogen that ultimately results in an epidemiological outbreak.

Worksheet 2: Sample size for disease detection

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

A: 59 individuals

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

A: The sample size necessary to detect in condition a) for a population of 5000 frogs would require sampling of 290 individuals. For detection in the case of b) in a population of 5000 frogs, 224 individuals will have to be sampled. It requires less individuals to detect a disease with 2% prevalence at a higher confidence level than it does to detect a disease which is prevalent in 1% of a population, using a lower confidence.
